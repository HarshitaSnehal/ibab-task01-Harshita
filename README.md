The goal of this task is to:
1. Install and configure Git and Github.
2. Create a new Git repository in Ubuntu.
3. Add files and push them to Github using SSH.

This repository includes a C program that implements Bubble sort- a simple algorithm used to sort elements in ascending order. This logic works as follows:
Compare adjacent elements in the array. If the left element is greater than the right one, swap them. Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.
